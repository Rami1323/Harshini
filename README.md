Hi Rj, 
FYI,
We have been actively working with both the Google and Quantiphi teams to address the challenges faced in our ongoing PoC using Agentspace.we have conducted a couple of working sessions to review the existing setup and configurations. While the environment appears to be correctly configured, and the files are successfully uploaded and indexed, we are still experiencing issues with retrieving accurate and complete outputs for certain documents.
Despite the pdf documentsuploaded  so far, some documents remain inaccessible through Agentspace. The Quantiphi team has performed an initial analysis and identified areas that require further investigation. To move forward, they have recommended organizing more formalized sessions in collaboration with the Google team to troubleshoot and explore potential solutions.
Please guide us to move forward.
